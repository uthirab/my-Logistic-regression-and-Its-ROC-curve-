Train Data set:
Created a 2000 2D multi-variate normal random number for both labels.
Train Data set:
Created a 2000 2D multi-variate normal random number for both labels.
Batch Training
η = {1, 0.1, 0.01}
Query1:
How many iterations did you go through the training dataset? What is the accuracy that you have? What are the edge weights that were learned?
Query2:
Online Training
η = {0.1, 0.01}
query2:
How many iterations did you go through your training dataset? What is the accuracy that you have? What are the edge weights that were learned? Compare
the learned parameters and accuracy to the ones that you got from batch training. Are they the same?

Learning:
Online Training has better accuracy than batch training. So they are not the same. Online training is much faster than batch training.
